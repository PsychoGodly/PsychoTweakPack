1. you can also clear up space on your ssd to help improve performance

2. getting a larger ssd can give greater performance too 
because they have have a better dram cache

3. dont defrag your ssd, in your search bar type Defragment and Optimize Drives, 
afetr opening make sure you turn off Scheduled Optimization. the only time you ever
need to defrag is with hard drives, doing it with ssd's provides no benefit and can
actually harm your ssd lifespan.
